            <center><h2>Tool Two: Crop Tool</h2></center><h1>The crop tool in Adobe Lightroom is a handy feature that allows you to change the size and shape of your photos. It helps you remove unwanted parts from the edges, focus on the important elements, or adjust the composition to make your pictures look more balanced and pleasing. You can also rotate your images to straighten them if they're slightly tilted. Using the crop tool is easy: just select the area you want to keep, and Lightroom does the rest, ensuring your final photo looks just the way you want.</h1>

            <center><h2>Tool Three: Healing Tool</h2></center><h1>The healing tool in Adobe Lightroom is a fantastic feature for fixing small imperfections in your photos, like blemishes or unwanted spots. It works by replacing the problem area with a clean section from another part of the image. This makes it look like the imperfection was never there. You can use the healing tool to touch up everything from minor skin flaws to distracting background objects. With a few clicks, your photos will appear smoother and more professional, as if you had the perfect shot from the start.</h1>

            <center><h2>Tool Four: Mask Tool</h2></center><h1>The mask tool in Adobe Lightroom is a powerful feature that lets you apply changes to specific parts of your photo without affecting the rest. You can use it to brighten just the sky, sharpen only the foreground, or enhance colors in particular areas. It works by allowing you to "mask" these sections, which means you can edit them separately. This tool is incredibly useful for making precise adjustments and can help bring out the best in your photos by focusing on just the parts you want to improve.</h1>
